# **AI-Driven Biodiversity Monitoring and Species Classification System**

🌿 *Aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goal 15 – Life on Land*

---

## **Abstract**

Biodiversity conservation is a critical global challenge addressed under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 – Life on Land. Accurate and timely identification of animal species plays a vital role in wildlife monitoring, conservation planning, and ecological research. However, traditional species identification methods are manual, time-consuming, and heavily dependent on domain experts. This project presents an AI-driven biodiversity monitoring system that leverages deep learning and computer vision to automatically classify animal species from images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with transfer learning, the system provides reliable species predictions along with confidence scores. The solution is deployed as an interactive web application, enabling easy access for researchers, students, and conservation stakeholders. The project demonstrates how responsible AI can support biodiversity awareness and sustainable environmental practices.

## **1. Introduction**

Biodiversity is essential for maintaining ecological balance, supporting human livelihoods, and ensuring environmental sustainability. Wildlife monitoring is a key component of biodiversity conservation, but it often involves extensive manual labor and expert intervention. With the growing availability of wildlife imagery from camera traps, drones, and citizen science initiatives, there is a need for scalable and automated systems that can assist in species identification.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning and computer vision, have shown strong potential in automating visual recognition tasks. This project explores the application of AI to biodiversity monitoring by developing an image-based animal species classification system aligned with SDG 15 – Life on Land.

## **2. Problem Statement**

Traditional biodiversity monitoring and animal species identification processes face several challenges:

* Manual identification is slow and resource-intensive.
* Dependence on experts limits scalability.
* Large volumes of wildlife imagery remain underutilized.
* Delays in species identification affect conservation decision-making.

There is a need for an automated, accessible, and reliable AI-based solution that can assist in identifying animal species from images while promoting responsible and ethical AI usage.

---

## **3. Objectives**

The primary objectives of this project are:

* To develop an AI-based system capable of classifying animal species from images.
* To support biodiversity monitoring aligned with UN SDG 15 – Life on Land.
* To deploy the solution as a user-friendly web application.
* To incorporate responsible AI principles such as transparency and confidence interpretation.
* To demonstrate an end-to-end AI pipeline from model training to deployment.

## **4. Dataset Description**

The project uses the **Animals-10 dataset**, which contains approximately 28,000 labeled animal images across ten categories:

* Dog
* Cat
* Horse
* Elephant
* Butterfly
* Spider
* Chicken
* Cow
* Sheep
* Squirrel

The dataset includes images collected from real-world sources with varying backgrounds and lighting conditions, simulating realistic scenarios encountered in wildlife monitoring.

## **5. Methodology**

### **5.1 Model Architecture**

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with **transfer learning** using **MobileNetV2** is employed. Transfer learning allows the model to leverage pre-trained knowledge from large-scale image datasets, improving accuracy and reducing training time.

### **5.2 Image Preprocessing**

* Image resizing to 224×224 pixels
* Normalization of pixel values
* Batch processing for efficient training

### **5.3 Training and Evaluation**

The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and optimized using the Adam optimizer. Performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics, achieving strong classification results across supported species.

### **5.4 Prediction Strategy**

The deployed system provides:

* Top-3 species predictions
* Confidence scores for each prediction
* Confidence-based interpretation for reliability assessment

---

## **6. System Architecture**

1. User uploads an animal image via the web interface
2. Image is preprocessed and passed to the trained CNN model
3. Model generates species predictions with confidence scores
4. Results are displayed through an interactive Streamlit interface

The architecture ensures modularity, scalability, and ease of deployment.
